# Python-CodeScreen-Fibonacci
Example CodeScreen Python assessment that requires the candidate to return the nth element in the Fibonacci sequence.

The sequence is assumed to be 0-indexed, with fibonacci(0) returning 0 and fibonacci(1) returning 1.

The file to write this function in is [fibonacci.py](fib/fibonacci.py).

The test cases that are run and are visible to the candidate are located in [test_fibonacci.py](test/test_fibonacci.py).

The test cases that are run and are hidden to the candidate are located in [test_hidden_fibonacci.py](test/test_hidden_fibonacci.py).
