The sequence is assumed to be 0-indexed, with fibonacci(0) returning 0 and fibonacci(1) returning 1.

The file to write this function in is `fib/fibonacci.py`.

The test cases that are run and are visible to the candidate are located in `test/test_fibonacci.py`.

The test cases that are run and are hidden to the candidate are located in `test/test_hidden_fibonacci.py`.
